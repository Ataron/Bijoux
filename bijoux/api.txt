Api.txt :

	Api.txt is this humble file in which you will get a lof of useful
informations about how bijoux works.

Atelier.lua :

	This file contain the basic register function for the "atelier", in
english "workbench". This workbench allows you to prune gems with basic
tools such as mese pickaxe, wooden pickaxe, and so many more.
	These "parfait" (perfect) gems are used to craft item and nodes.
	The file also contain the mecanism, the ABM (ActiveBlockModifier)
function used to make the workbench work, and finally it contains the
recipe registration system. Registering a recipe means the workbench
will detect an item inserted in it as prunable or not prunable. It
proceeds in this way : it searchs if atelier.recipes[itemstring] exists,
because if it does, it means the item designed by itemstring is
classified as ready to be used, and prunable to give in exchange the
item which its itemstring is atelier.recipes[itemstring].
	To put it in a nutshell, it's like a craft registration.
	The function to register works like this :
	
	atelier.register_recipe(parameters)
	^
	parameters is a table that must contain these things :
		- output   : The item given in exchange of the item inserted
		- input    : The item that will be exchanged for output item
		- duration : The time you will have to wait to prune the gem
		
	eg. :
	
	atelier.register_recipe({
		output = "bijoux:perle",
		input  = "bijoux:perle_imparfait",
		duration = 5
	})
	
	WARNING: It's deprecated to register manually an item and its output
	because the	function is usually used with some other specific
	functions. Otherwise, if you're sure about what you do, go haed!
